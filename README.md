## Cohort 15
### Connect 4

This is a didactic exercise in Object Decomposition for Launch Academy's 15th cohort (Boston Winter 2016.) The exercise was cowboy-coded (*not* test-driven) for maximum messiness and "spaghetti code". It was then partially decomposed into marginally better code during one of our onsite clinics.
